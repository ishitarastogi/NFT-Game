# NFT-Game
create a NFT game  with frontend using Reactjs

# Tokenization

1. Trading of tokens
2. Movement of tokens
3. Voting with tokens or certain things related with token

Decentralization: ability to have multiple idependent nodes computing and validating data

For vrf we need two functions:

# requestRandomness
# Make a request to the VRF coordinator.
```shell
function requestRandomness(bytes32 _keyHash, uint256 _fee)
    public returns (bytes32 requestId)
```
# @params:

1. _keyHash: The public key against which randomness is generated. See Chainlink VRF Addresses for details.
2. _fee: The fee, in LINK, for the request. Specified by the oracle.

# @return value
RETURN: The ID unique to a single request.

# fulfillRandomness

Called by VRFCoordinator when it receives a valid VRF proof. Override this function to act upon the random number generated by Chainlink VRF.
```shell
function fulfillRandomness(bytes32 requestId, uint256 randomness)
    external virtual;
```
# @params
requestId: The Id initially returned by requestRandomness.
randomness: Random number generated by Chainlink VRF.
